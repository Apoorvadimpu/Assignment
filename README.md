# Assignment

The technologies used to build the project are Angular, Node.js and monodb.

I have done the UI design in angular and included routing with two components and the content card data is hard coded in contentcardComponent.ts file as of now. The mongodb schema is done and data entry into the db was not done from the postman due to post 400 BadRequest. The node.js server is running fine.
